## About me

I've got my PhD in Astronomy in 2009 studying the [properties of dark matter halos](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.381.1450N) in cosmological simulations such as the [Millennium simulation](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium/). 

Since then, I've worked for large astronomical projects like the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.aura-astronomy.org/centers/nsfs-oir-lab/rubinobservatory/). 

While in DES, I developed Quick Reduce, a system for monitoring the quality of the Dark Energy camera images in real-time. My participation in DES includes several projects, in particular, a system for [creating science-ready catalogs](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....24...52F) from the DES data releases. 

As of 2015, I moved to Tucson, AZ to work at Vera C. Rubin Observatory as a member of the Data Management team. At Rubin we are building a unique wide field optical telescope that will conduct the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/). The survey will collect about 500 petabytes of image data by observing the southern sky continuously over 10-years starting in 2024. Rubin Observaotry will also produce nearly instant alerts for objects that change in position or brightness in the sky every night. 

My main project at Rubin Observatory is [Sasquatch](https://sqr-068.lsst.io) a service for recording, displaying, and alerting on Rubinâ€™s engineering data. Sasquatch architecture is based on [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), an open-source time-series database optimized for efficient storage and analysis of time series data, and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) which is used as a write-ahead log to InfluxDB and for data replication between the observatory and our data facility at SLAC.
