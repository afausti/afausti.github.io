## About me

I've got my PhD in Astronomy in 2009 studying the [properties of dark matter halos](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.381.1450N) in cosmological simulations such as the [Millennium simulation](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium/). 

Since then, I've worked in large astronomical projects like the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/). 

While in DES, I developed Quick Reduce (QR), a system for monitoring the quality of the Dark Energy camera images in real-time. My participation in DES includes several projects, in particular, a system for [creating science-ready catalogs](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....24...52F) from the DES data releases. 

As of 2015, I moved to Tucson, AZ and started working for LSST as a software engineer. LSST is building a unique wide-field optical telescope in Chile. It will collect about 500 petabytes of image data by observing the skies continuously for 10-years, and produce nearly instant alerts for objects that change in position or brightness every night. I'm a member of the LSST data management team, and my main projects are a service for monitoring the LSST Science Pipeline's metrics and the [Engineering Facility Database](https://sqr-034.lsst.io/) that will record data from inumerous devices and sensors to monitor the telescope and the observatory.
