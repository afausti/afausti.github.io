## About me

I earned my PhD in Astronomy in 2008, studying the [properties of dark matter halos](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.381.1450N) in cosmological simulations such as the [Millennium simulation](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium/). 

Since then, I’ve contributed to large-scale astronomical projects, [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://project.lsst.org). 

At DES, I worked on multiple initiatives, notably Quick Reduce, a system for real-time image quality monitoring for the Dark Energy Camera, and the [generation of science-ready catalogs](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....24...52F) for public data releases.

In 2015, I moved to Tucson, AZ, to join the Rubin Observatory’s Data Management team. Rubin is building a revolutionary wide-field optical telescope to carry out the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will observe the southern sky over ten years starting in 2025. The LSST will generate ~500 petabytes of imaging data and produce real-time alerts for transient and variable objects nightly.

My primary project at Rubin is [Sasquatch](https://sasquatch.lsst.io), a system for recording, visualizing, and alerting on the observatory’s engineering data. Sasquatch leverages InfluxDB for efficient time-series storage and analytics and Apache Kafka for streaming data to InfluxDB and our data facility at SLAC.
