## About me

I've got my PhD in Astronomy in 2009 studying the [properties of dark matter halos](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.381.1450N) in cosmological simulations such as the [Millennium simulation](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium/). 

Since then, I've worked for large astronomical projects like the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.aura-astronomy.org/centers/nsfs-oir-lab/rubinobservatory/). 

While in DES, I developed Quick Reduce, a system for monitoring the quality of the Dark Energy camera images in real-time. My participation in DES includes several projects, in particular, a system for [creating science-ready catalogs](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....24...52F) from the DES data releases. 

As of 2015, I moved to Tucson, AZ to work at Rubin Observatory as a member of the Data Management team. At Rubin Observatory we are building a unique wide field optical telescope that will conduct the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/). The survey will collect about 500 petabytes of image data by observing the southern sky continuously over 10-years starting in late 2022. LSST will also produce nearly instant alerts for objects that change in position or brightness every night. My main projects at Rubin Observatory are a service for monitoring the LSST Science Pipeline's metrics and the [Engineering Facility Database](https://sqr-034.lsst.io/) that will record data from inumerous devices and sensors to monitor the telescope and the observatory.
